factors that influence student performance. This project seeks to provide that 
information by visualizing data from a learning management system.

## Audience

Our target audience is educators who want to learn what factors affect student 
performance, particularly in relation to learning management systems.


## Data

The dataset we will be using is “Students’ Academic Performance Dataset,” 
which was collected by Elaf Abu Amrieh, Thair Hamtini, and Ibrahim Aljarah 
from the University of Jordan. We accessed it on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aljarah/xAPI-Edu-Data/home). 
It is an educational dataset collected from the learning management system Kalboard 360, 
which allows students to access educational resources from any device connected 
to the internet and monitors their learning progress and behaviors. The dataset 
consists of a sample of 480 students and their associated attributes, including gender, 
grade level, participation in discussion groups, absences, and more. The students are also 
classified into numeric intervals based on their grades.


## Questions

- Which grade category has the highest average participation? What are the differences in the 
  average participation scores? How does this vary between genders?

- Which country’s students have the highest and lowest mean of academic achievements?

- Which grade category has the highest parental survey response rate? How does the response 
  rate differ by school stages?
